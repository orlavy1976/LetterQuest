I am developing a react native app. It is a letter quest where the player has to replace numbers with letters and discover the sentence behind it. In this session I would like to try and improve some aspects of the app. Please be concise and short in your answers. If something is not clear ask. generate code only when I specifically ask for it and send only the relevant code, not entire components. Understood?
